<h1 style="color:#3776AB;">python_DSA</h1>

<p style="color:#444;">
This is my personal space for studying and practicing Python.  
I'm rebuilding my understanding of the language from the ground up - starting with the basics and moving toward deeper topics like data structures, algorithms, and performance.
</p>

<h2 style="color:#3776AB;">About</h2>

<p style="color:#444;">
The main goal of this repository is to get comfortable with Python's core concepts, syntax, and internal logic.  
Along the way, I’ll be writing small programs, notes, and experiments that help me think in Python and apply it naturally as a developer.
</p>

<h2 style="color:#3776AB;">Structure</h2>

<ul style="color:#444; line-height:1.6;">
  <li><strong>basics/</strong> – syntax, data types, loops, and functions</li>
  <li><strong>intermediate/</strong> – OOP, error handling, and modules</li>
  <li><strong>dsa/</strong> – data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving</li>
  <li><strong>projects/</strong> – small builds to apply what I learn</li>
  <li><strong>notes/</strong> – thoughts, summaries, and lessons learned</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="color:#3776AB;">Purpose</h2>

<p style="color:#444;">
To strengthen my foundation in Python, explore how far it can be pushed, and merge it with my current development knowledge.  
This is more about clarity and depth than speed - I want to really understand how and why things work.
</p>

<h2 style="color:#3776AB;">Current Focus</h2>

<p style="color:#444;">
Working through core syntax, functions, and understanding Python’s object model.  
Next steps will involve implementing data structures manually to understand their behavior.
</p>

<p style="color:#888;">
Personal project for learning and mastery.
